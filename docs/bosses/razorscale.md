# Razorscale

## Overview

> There are ideally only three Phases in this fight, but Phase 1 and 2 might repeat if DPS is low.  
> In Phase1 Adds will be fought until the Boss can be grounded.  
> In Phase2 the Boss is harmless and nothing can damage the Raid except leftover Adds.  
> In Phase3 no Adds will spawn but the Boss will fight the Raid.
