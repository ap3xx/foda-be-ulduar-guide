# Flame Leviathan

## Overview

> This Hard Mode is significantly more challenging than the extremely simple Normal Mode (which can be cleared with 4-6 Players instead of 25, good for alts).  
> The Hard Mode must be toggled on by the Raid Leader before Trash is cleared.  
> It is also known as “4 Towers”, as there are 4 Towers found in the large area where Trash is cleared before the Boss. By default, you may choose to deactivate all these Towers. Otherwise, they will be active, empowering the Boss, and may be destroyed (to achieve a combination of Towers of your choice).  
> Thus, for practice, it is possible to kill the Boss with 1, 2, or 3 towers. But this will not yield the “Hard Mode” loot table, and generally our time is better spent in other ways.
