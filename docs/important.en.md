# Important read

## Formating

We use text format to give different levels of attention:

__Bold__: This is a dangerous mechanic or boss skill.  
<ins>Underline</ins>: This is very important for the fight execution.  
_Italic_: This can be misunderstood, read carefully.

## Commonly used terms

These terms will be placeholders to simplify explanations: 

__"The Raid"__:  The 25 Players, or at least the largest stack of Players.  
__"A Player"__:  Any of the 25 gamers in the Raid.  
__"NPC"__:  Unless specified otherwise, a hostile one.  
__"Adds"__:  Unless specified otherwise, hostile ones.  
__"P1, P2, P3"__:  The specified boss phase.  
__"The Boss deals damageâ€¦"__:  Unless specified otherwise, to his current Tank.  
__"Raid-Wide"__:  Something that affects all 25 Players unless specified otherwise.  
__"Enrage"__:  Mechanic that punishes the Players for taking too long, or for failing a mechanic.  
__"Soft Enrage"__:  One that has some variance rather than being hard capped in minutes.  
__"Externals"__:  Damage reduction buffs that are not cast by the tank itself (`Divine Sac`, `Pain Supression`, etc).

## Tags

Bosses may have the follwing tags:

__Skippable__: if True, means that boss is not obligatory for the raid completion.  
__Difficult__: there are different levels of difficulty, ranging from `Very Easy` to `Very Hard`.

_Obs: tags can also be used to search_
