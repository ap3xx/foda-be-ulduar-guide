## Formating guide

During the guides, we are gonna use specific formatting with specific meanings:

__Bold__: Shit’s dangerous, yo.  
<ins>Underline</ins>: Shit’s noteworthy for the strat, yo.  
_Italic_: Shit needs to be read carefully because often misunderstood, yo.  
Boss does This (_also That?_): This part of the strat is true (_this part must be verified?_)
