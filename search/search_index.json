In this case, we\u2019ll kill Stormcaller Brundir -> Runemaster Molgeim -> Steelbreaker. (\u201cSmall to Big\u201d) It is assumed you\u2019re aware of all Normal Mode mechanics. Full Mechanics Rundown Similarly to Normal Mode, each Boss gains new abilities at each Boss\u2019 death. The order matters greatly though, as you\u2019ll see. As Stormcaller Brundir will die first you have not much to worry about him, aside from at least 1 Overload happening before he\u2019ll die, so be ready to move out. P1 P1 is identical to Normal Mode. P2 Runemaster Molgeim will behave similarly to Normal Mode and the same important mechanics remain: DPS in Rune of Power, spread for Rune of Death and attempt to dispel Shield of Runes. But differences are also present: Steelbreaker, however, gains a noticeable mechanic: He\u2019ll cast Static Disruption at the furthest Player from him . This deals a large amount of Nature damage and further increases the Nature damage taken by the target by 75% per application (it can stack). This also applies to all other Players in a large radius around the target! That Player will ideally be an assigned Healer, usually HPal (who can Bubble the stacks away). If the soaker has too many stacks, he\u2019ll simply swap with another healer. This mechanic seems simple at first but can get awry when DPS are spreading for a Rune of Death (thus increasing how far they are from Steelbreaker), or if Steelbreaker is moved (due to a Rune of Death) away from the Raid\u2026 The general rule of thumb is that DPS should keep in mind the closer they are to Steelbreaker (even though Runemaster Molgeim is the kill target), the safer they are from this mechanic. As for Normal Mode, it is ideal to kill Runemaster Molgeim (and begin P3) right after he dropped a Rune of Power. A Stop DPS might be called. In this case having a fresh rune is nearly mandatory to beat P3. P3 Only Steelbreaker remains, dealing even higher damage with all abilities. His Fusion Punches (which keep happening the whole fight) will be lethal on the tank at this point if he uses no cooldowns or receives no externals. He will continue to cast Static Disruption, but soaking it will be much easier since no other movement will be required by the other mechanics. High Voltage : This ability is actually active since P1, but is irrelevant until P3. Steelbreaker simply deals constant Nature damage to the whole Raid which must be healed through constantly. This should not be a problem if Static Disruptions are properly soaked. Extreme Caution should be used when using a Soulstone or accepting a BRez during that Phase, as one tick of High Voltage will kill you instantly after rezzing if you receive no Heals. Watch a melee DPS\u2019s health bar, wait until they get damaged for 2000-3000 damage, then accept instantly the soulstone/brez and heal yourself if you have a way to. Electrical Charge: Whenever a Player dies in this Phase, Steelbreaker will be healed for 20% HP and will increase all further damage he\u2019ll deal by 25% . This is extremely dangerous with one Player death, and is a guaranteed wipe at two Player deaths. Dying instantly after a Soulstone/Brez (see above) means giving not one, but two stacks of this mechanic, basically causing a wipe by yourself. Overwhelming Power : Very soon after P3 begins, Steelbreaker will Debuff his current target. The debuff causes the target to deal triple damage, at the cost of dying at the end of the debuff (35 seconds), also killing any nearby Players. When the debuff expires, Steelbreaker repeats the process and Debuffs his current target again. This Phase is thus a huge DPS and healing race to kill Steelbreaker before the guaranteed Player deaths push him out of control. Essentials Tanks Steelbreaker\u2019s Tank must use his cooldowns wisely, as the Fusion Punches in P2 and 3 are lethal or close to. Runemaster Molgeim\u2019s Tank can weave cooldowns when the Boss\u2019 Shield of Runes gets broken (causing him to deal +50% damage) P2 Steelbreaker must be kept close to the stacked Raid as often as possible to ensure he doesn\u2019t Static Disruption the wrong Player. It must also be ensured Steelbreaker never remains in a Rune of Power for too long. (Close to the Raid means, in other words, stacked with Runemaster Molgeim) Do not Taunt Steelbreaker back when the Hunter taunts him in P3, until the Debuff has been applied . If something goes wrong with the debuff and you receive it, make sure you run out of the Raid (once the second tank took the Boss off you). Healers Keep Tanks topped up, as they might take not-so-predictable spikes of damage (Shield of Runes broken, Rune of Power on top of a Boss till he gets moved out, Tank getting hit in the back during movement\u2026) especially as you\u2019ll often have to move and thus heal at lower efficiency. Externals will be needed on Steelbreaker\u2019s Tank starting in P3. Starting P2, all Healers should be aware of what Soaking is: Stay the furthest possible from Steelbreaker, range12 away from anyone else, and run back in if you\u2019ve received a stack of Static Disruption. (while ensuring the other Healers know one has to get out and soak in your stead) Extreme Raid Healing will be required in P3 but keep in mind the general rule is that no one must die, no matter the role/class/spec/gear/importance. DPS You will always have to run away from an Overload before Stormcaller Brundir dies. Starting at P2 you should not be the furthest Player from Steelbreaker. If you find yourself in that situation (like when spreading away for a Rune of Death) simply ensure that you\u2019re not close to other Players, especially when running back in. If your class has survivability cooldowns you should save them for P3 as long as they\u2019re not required to prevent your death, of course. Same goes to healthstones. Save DPS cooldowns for P3 as well and be able to stop DPS for the last Rune of Power. Special Assignments 2-3 Healers should be able to communicate and understand Static Disruption soaking. Heroism is on P3 A.S.A.P, assuming a Rune of Power is there. Given the roughness of P3 Healing, a macro-ed Felhunter would be best to remove Fusion Punch and save GCDs on the Healers. Even if a Paladin Tank can self-dispel, the damage dealt by one of his dps GCDs would be worth it given how intense a DPS race P3 is.","title":"[HM] Assembly of Iron"},{"location":"hard/council/#assembly-of-iron","text":"","title":"Assembly of Iron"},{"location":"hard/council/#overview","text":"Hard Mode IC is not quite \u201cenabled\u201d like previous Hard Modes, but instead achieved if Steelbreaker is the last Boss to die.

The Hard Mode must be toggled on by the Raid Leader before Trash is cleared. It is also known as \"4 Towers\", as there are 4 Towers found in the large area where Trash is cleared before the Boss. By default, you may choose to deactivate all these Towers. Otherwise, they will be active, empowering the Boss, and may be destroyed (to achieve a combination of Towers of your choice). Thus, for practice, it is possible to kill the Boss with 1, 2, or 3 towers. But this will not yield the \"Hard Mode\" loot table, and generally our time is better spent in other ways. Full Mechanics Rundown All the mechanics from Normal Mode, with no exception, remain . Each Tower greatly buffs the Boss and any Adds. The amount and stats of the buffs are somewhat irrelevant. The Tower of Frost causes Frost Beams (of Light Blue color) to sometimes appear in the arena. They will roam around, looking for Vehicles to lock onto. They cause no damage by themselves, but once locked on they will stop roaming around and prepare a projectile . If the Vehicle fails to escape the Beam when it locks onto it, it will be frozen and take a large amount of damage. All Players must be wary of this, as it may cause a wipe . Allies may free Frozen vehicles by shooting cannonballs on them . The Tower of Flame causes a Flame Beam (Orange/Red color) to roam the arena. This one causes constant, near-lethal damage, also leaving a similarly near-lethal burnt ground where it passed through . This \"fire wall\" can easily trap vehicles in corners where they might get killed by the Boss or unable to perform their assignment. All Players must be wary of it, and preemptively move away from the Flame Beam's path, and away from the Beam in general . The Tower of Storm causes a Storm Beam (Bright/White color) to appear in the arena. It is immobile but will deal massive damage to anyone in it. All Players must be wary of it . Must not be mistaken for Frost Beams. The Tower of Life causes Adds to appear in the 4 corners of the arena . There are both large, dangerous Adds and smaller, less threatening Adds. They appear as if created by the 4 Life Beams (green color) in the corners ; The Beams also do damage but should not be on the Players\u2019 paths anyway. Adds can be killed by all Players (though it is preferable to respect assignment) and may be knocked away (by ramming them) or slowed (by Oil Patches). Flame Leviathan actually has 4 NPCs on top of him, which are his Turrets. They cannot be conventionally killed. Once they are all 4 destroyed (simultaneously?), the Flame Leviathan will Shut Down, disabling it entirely for 20 seconds and taking +50% Damage for the duration . It also resets the stacks of his ramping-up Movement Speed. Essentials Siege Engine Driver You are the prime candidate to Ram Adds away to damage and control them. In fact, each Engine will be assigned to 1 corner of the arena each, and the 5th one will be assigned to always be on the Boss to Interrupt . Use your Dash to escape the dangerous Beams or the Boss. Estimated Difficulty of the role: 5/10 Siege Engine Passenger You must use Cannonballs to ignite Oil Patches created by the Choppers . That way, the Oil will burn Adds, killing them with ease. Use the Shield if your Driver drives into certain death and pain. Estimated Difficulty of the role: 4/10 Chopper Driver You actually have a job now! Drop Oil Patches in the 4 corners , where Adds spawn. They will be lit up by other Players to handle Adds that stand in the burning Oil. The more well-placed Oil Patches, the better. (One Chopper will be assigned per corner) You must go to the Boss when instructed to, to pick up assigned Players into your Passenger seat and drive them back to the safety of their Demolisher. There will be marked assignments to make sure each Chopper handles each Player back to its assigned Demolisher. Estimated Difficulty of the role: 7/10 Demolisher Driver Be extremely wary of your survival , as the premature death of a Demolisher means a certain wipe. ( Only applies to some Demolishers ) You must catapult your Passenger onto the Boss when instructed to . Make sure to aim directly on the Boss, preferably slightly towards his upper half. You cannot shoot Pyrite when your Passenger is loaded and awaiting your fire command, so be quick and make sure to refresh Pyrite one last time when we instruct Passengers to load themselves . The additional hazards of the Beams mean you might require more Pyrite than usual, as your Passenger might use it to give you a sprint. Make sure you drive close to Pyrite crates . Obviously, while your Passenger is gone, you will not be refueled Pyrite while in the driver seat! You can either refresh the Pyrite DoT the latest possible (recommended), or switch to the passenger seat, pick Pyrite, and switch back to the driver seat before the Pyrite DoT expires . Attention Not all Demolishers might be assigned to catapulting their passengers. (In which case your job will only be slightly harder than Normal Mode) Estimated Difficulty of the role: 9/10. Demolisher Passenger You will have to Sprint more often than in Normal Mode to escape danger, but keep in mind it costs a lot of the precious Pyrite. ( Only applies to some Demolishers ) Fill your vehicle to 100% Pyrite (\"mana\") before Catapulting yourself, if assigned to . Preferably wait to see your Driver shooting one last Pyrite projectile before loading up, as he will be unable to refresh Pyrite while you\u2019re loaded. If Catapulted successfully, kill Turrets A.S.A.P, using all DPS Cooldowns you can. Once Turrets are destroyed you will fall to the ground. You should not be in danger for the 20 seconds of the Shutdown, so make your way back to your assigned Demolisher - Either by walking or jumping into a friendly Chopper . If at any moment you\u2019re on the ground while the Boss isn\u2019t Shut Down , use as much survivability (healthstones\u2026) as possible and run to an empty vehicle. Attention Not all Demolishers might be assigned to catapulting their passengers. (In which case your job will only be slightly harder than Normal Mode) Estimated Difficulty of the role: 8.5/10. Special Assignments Siege Engines: Assigned to a corner or to stick on the Boss. Demolisher: Assigned or not to Catapult their Passengers. Choppers: Assigned to bring Passengers back to their Demolisher, and to each corner. 1 Shaman: Will be assigned to leave his vehicle and Heroism while close enough to the Boss, to help the Turret killers; then back to his vehicle. Note Due to the high variance of the fight (who gets chased, where do Flame Beams go\u2026) a picture would be mostly pointless.","title":"[HM] Flame Leviathan"},{"location":"hard/flame_leviathan/#hard-mode-flame-leviathan","text":"","title":"Hard Mode Flame Leviathan"},{"location":"hard/flame_leviathan/#overview","text":"This Hard Mode is significantly more challenging than the extremely simple Normal Mode (which can be cleared with 4-6 Players instead of 25, good for alts).

It is ideal to kill the Heart by using as few Cooldowns as possible (both DPS individual CDs and Heroism) as these will be needed for the rest of the fight. Full Mechanics Rundown Both Debuffs will gain an additional new behavior : Searing Light when it expires, will instantly spawn an Add called Life Spark .

It also deals moderate AoE Nature damage around it. Life Sparks are #1 DPS Focus at any moment they exist. The Debuffed Player must thus not only move out of the Raid to not kill allies with Searing Light, but also make his way to be ~20yds away from the tank to allow for a very quick taunt.

This is a long, channeled spell that deals insanely high Damage per second to the whole Raid, scaling on their Max HP (200% HP over the duration). This is a very demanding mechanic, for which I will thoroughly detail individual responsibilities in the Essentials below . Strategy Image Reference Essentials Tanks All Tanks should weave defensive cooldowns during Tantrum. XT is also punishing to Tanks outside of Tantrums, but Healers will have infinitely less pressure in those moments. Paladin Tanks can use Hand of Freedom on Gravity Bombs that are about to expire, and Hand of Protection on debuffed Players if a Tantrum is about to happen (the HoP will prevent Tantrum damage, but not the debuff itself. Taking damage from both is often lethal) Druid Tanks can use Barkskin + Tranquility during Tantrums (healing cooldowns will be on rotation) if they make sure they shift to Bear before the Tantrum ends. Healers For Tantrums, all Healers will be assigned to heal a group(1 to 5) and/or to specific targets . Is it primordial to respect that assignment as closely as possible, as the whole Raid will take very heavy damage and no Player can be left unhealed. Searing Light debuffed Players should receive a nonstop heal spam and sniped with a Heal that lands as perfectly as possible to the expiration of the debuff. Gravity Bombs must only be topped off + shielded. This is a very long fight with extremely high HPS output and mana preservation is paramount. Care should be paid to allow Paladins to Divine Plea and Tide/Hymns of Hope to be efficient. Extra-ordinary Healing Cooldowns (DHymn, Tranq) will be assigned. Two HPals will alternate Bubble+RaidSac on each Tantrum. Hpals will probably be assigned to heal melee groups. Resto Druids will probably actually be forbidden to use Tranquility at the profit of their better spells, unless we run 6+ Healers. Resto Shamans will likely be assigned to heal Ranged groups (they will be spread, but close enough for ChainHeals) Discipline will have to preshield as many Players as he can before Tantrum (ideally 25), then weave shield+PoH and PoM off cooldown. He will PoH his assigned group. HolyPriest will have to precast PoM and spam PoH+CoH on his assigned group. Might vary with talents. DPS All classes/specs DPS priority : Life Sparks >>>>> Any leftover Pummelers when Hard Mode begins >>> Boss. Healthstones should be saved for situations where a Searing Light is about to kill you or for a Tantrum where the Raid is starting to drop. In general, you\u2019re free to healthstone if you reach 20% hp during a Tantrum or from a Searing Light damage. Hitting zero Raid members with your Gravity Bomb is mandatory . Hitting the least possible Players with your Searing Lights is required, and you must be in Taunt range of the Tank when your Searing Light debuff expires . List of DPS classes/specs and your job during Tantrums : Arms/Fury : Enraged Regeneration and Shieldwall, preferably one per Tantrum and not the one Heroism will be used on. Ret : Might be assigned to DSac rotation. Freely use FoL heal procs on low hp Players. Sacred Shield yourself before Tantrum. Bubble/Shieldwall whenever lacking Forbearance. Hunter : Deterrence shouldn\u2019t help against Tantrum, but check if it does, once. Rather, use Deterrence when Searing Light is about to expire so that the Life Spark ignores you. Rogue : Use Feint on every Tantrum. Do not Cloak of Shadows a Gravity Bomb. Can Cloak of Shadows instantly on Searing Light, assuming the Tank can react accordingly. Shadow Priest : Will be assigned for a DHymn. For all other tantrums, should use PoM when Tantrum begins, and refresh DoTs just before. Might have to also spam PoH, but the push-back from Tantrum will probably make it inefficient. Death Knight : Must Death Strike at least once during the Tantrum and use IBF whenever up during a Tantrum. Save AMS for Searing Lights, as Tantrum is Physical Damage. If Frost, Ghoul+DeathPact whenever you\u2019re not using IBF. If Unholy, be ready to Death Pact if you reach 20% HP. Balance : Will be assigned to a Tranquility (with a Barkskin to avoid pushback). Will Barkskin every Tantrum anyway. Cast heals during the Tantrum, whichever is the highest output that doesn\u2019t get you oom (pre-shotting Lifeblooms right before Tantrum is a good idea). Is allowed to have bad DPS as a consequence. Feral : Will be assigned to a Tranquility (with a Barkskin to avoid pushback). Will Barkskin every Tantrum anyway. Survival Instincts whenever up. Shifting into Bear Form is not mandatory since Cat takes -30% AoE Damage, but can Bear+Frenzied Regen during his Survival Instincts. Mage : Can IceBlock freely on Tantrums, but better saved in case of a bad Searing Light. Obviously never Ice Block a Gravity Bomb and never Ice Block a Searing Light if you\u2019re not in range of the tank and outside the Raid. Always Blink when receiving a Searing Light. Warlocks : Affli should Drain Life during Tantrum and Death Coil during Tantrum whenever up. Demono should save Metamorphosis for Tantrum due to increased Armor and how he\u2019ll be free to run into melee range without fear of debuffs. Elemental : Must spam Chain Heals during the whole Tantrum. The temporary haste from Elemental Mastery will benefit those casts. Enhancement : Must expend Maelstrom procs into Chain Heals (or a nicely sniped Healing Wave) for the whole Tantrum. Can expend incomplete Maelstrom stacks for more heals.

Multidotting and cleaving is thus entirely useless (except maybe the case of Affliction\u2019s Eradication uptime) The three Bosses are Steelbreaker (Giant), Runemaster Molgeim (Vrykul), and Stormcaller Brundir (Dwarf). For Normal Mode, they will die in this order (\u201cBig to Small\u201d) P1 All Bosses are alive and this Phase ends when Steelbreaker dies . The fight may be either 2-tanked or 3-tanked. Steelbreaker will cast Fusion Punch at his current tank, dealing high Nature damage and applying a lethal Nature DoT. A Paladin Tank may dispel it on himself instantly, other Tanks will rely on a Healer or a Felhunter dispelling it instantly. Runemaster Molgeim casts Shield of Runes, which should be spell-stolen instantly as much as possible. Not a big deal in Normal Mode. He also casts Rune of Power under either of his 2 fellow Bosses , dropping a large blue AoE. Any Boss or Player in this AoE deals +50% damage . It is thus vital to move the Bosses out of it and have as many DPS in it as possible. Stormcaller Brundir casts interruptible Lightning Bolts and Chain Lightning, of no danger. He can also be stunned in this Phase (and this one only). He will be tanked far away from the Raid as he also casts Overload, a long cast that causes lethal AoE damage to anyone nearby . If his Tank and the rest of the Raid are positioned properly this should be no issue, but it must be paid attention to. P2 Steelbreaker dies but the 2 other Bosses retain all their spells, deal increased damage, and gain new abilities : Runemaster Molgeim will now be the DPS target. He still casts Shield of Runes, which should be spell-stolen or dispelled instantly when he completes the cast. If not dispelled, Runemaster Molgeim will deal +50% damage for a while. This is manageable in Normal Mode. He will still cast Rune of Power and DPS must make use of the zone. Runemaster Molgeim is now able to cast Rune of Death. This drops a very large Green AoE at the current location of a Player . The zone inflicts heavy Shadow Damage every second to any Player in it. DBM will be call to spread around and stay clear of the Rune of Power . When the Rune of Death drops, all Players should move out of it and then move back to the Rune of Power to DPS . Stormcaller Brundir is now able to cast Lightning Whirl . This is an Interruptible channel which, every few seconds, will deal near-lethal Nature damage to a few random Raid members . This should be Interrupted near-instantly . If Brundir\u2019s Tank is Paladin or Druid, it will be required that a DPS (Shaman/DK/War/Rogue\u2026) will stay on Brundir for Interrupts , in spite of his DPS being wasted on him. P2 ends when Runemaster Molgeim dies. If possible, DPS will halt until Molgeim drops a fresh Rune of Power (they have a limited duration) in order to end the fight faster thanks to the increased DPS. P3 Only Stormcaller Brundir remains, dealing further increased damage with all his mechanics. He will reflect some damage when hit by Autoattacks, but it is easily healed through. His melee swings are also still close to negligible. Now that all DPS are focusing on him, his Lightning Whirls should be Interrupted instantly by DKs and Enhancement Shamans. His new ability is Lightning Tendrils and will be cast regularly during the fight. When he does, he will fly up in the air (while remaining targetable for Ranged DPS) and deal extremely heavy damage to anyone close to him . He is able to move during this ability and will randomly chase Players at high speed . It is preferable for the chased Player to actually stand still and pray for heals rather than risk running away from Healers or running into friends . Losing Players is acceptable as long as Brundir eventually dies to DPS. He will almost always cast a Lightning Whirl when ending his Lightning Tendrils (usually resetting Threat in the process), thus Ranged DPS should be on the lookout for interrupts as Melees will not be in range yet. He still casts Overload! And he often uses Lightning Whirl after one. Essentials Tanks Move Bosses out of Runes of Power (blue) while ensuring Melee DPS can sit in the Rune and still reach your Boss if he\u2019s the kill target. You too can be a Rune of Death target.

Normal Mode Freya will usually involve killing these 3 Mini Bosses before engaging her. Freya heals herself for massive amounts, decaying over the course of the fight. DPSing her on pull is utterly useless and a waste of trinket procs. A fairly unremarkable Phase2 will happen once that healing is removed by dealing with 6 waves of Adds. Mini-bosses Rundown Elder Stonebark, first to be pulled, uses Ground Tremors, dealing Raidwide damage and interrupting. He buffs himself with Stone Bark, causing massive reflect damage on melee hits . Dual Wielders should stop DPSing entirely. He buffs himself with Fists of Stone, massively increasing his melee damage but slowing him. The Tank must run out. Elder Ironbranch, second one in the back right, casts Iron Roots on a single random Player. This places a \u201cIron Roots\u201d NPC on top of the Player, which keeps the Player debuffed with a snare and large damage over time. Killing the NPC removes the debuff, as does Hand of Freedom (shouldn\u2019t happen pre-nerfs) He\u2019ll also Impale the Tank, dealing massive damage. Should be a Tank swap but can be survived through. Elder Brightleaf, the last one, regularly shoots high-damage bolts at random Players that can\u2019t be avoided and might cause butthurt due to one-shots. He also places Sunbeams that continuously damage Players under it, and continuously empower him if he stays under it. Tank should simply keep moving him nonstop. Full Mechanics Rundown Note that Freya will be engaging the Tank in melee during the whole fight, but the damage is easily fixed. Sunbeam: One of the few spells Freya herself will use. Simply deals AoE damage on a random Player after a short cast. Can\u2019t really be avoided, but rewards spreading. Eonar\u2019s Gift/Lifebinder\u2019s Gift : Spawns a small targetable tree NPC. If the tree remains alive for long enough (~15s?), it will massively heal Freya and any Adds present. This is not a hard mechanic, even in Hard Mode: The tree dies easily even to a single Player collapsing on it. Attuned to Nature: As mentioned before, Freya will heal herself constantly. Every wave of Adds that she summons will reduce the healing by 1/6th. She won\u2019t summon Adds after the 6th wave, which is when her healing will be near-nullified. When that happens, a short Phase2 begins. These 6 waves of Adds are on a timer, so it is possible to have several waves if the DPS is low, or a large dull empty time if DPS is high. They spawn in a random order, but will always involve three types of waves, happening twice each. Now, onto the Adds: Ancient Conservator The Ancient Conservator is a single, large treant. Upon spawning he will cast Conservator\u2019s Grip. The Conservator\u2019s Grip continuously Silences and Pacifies anyone who\u2019s not standing under Mushrooms that continuously sprout around the room, grow in size and then eventually shrink. Standing under a Mushroom grants a +50% Damage increase to reward you while we\u2019re at it. The Mushrooms still spawn even when Conservator\u2019s Grip is cancelled. As long as the Conservator is alive, Nature\u2019s Fury will be regularly cast on one random Player. Nature\u2019s Fury (A.K.A Lightning Rod) deals large Nature Damage every second to any other Players near the debuffed Player . Move out of the Raid! Exploding Lashers A swarm of ~12 smaller Adds. They deal noticeable damage to their threat target in spite of how many there are, caution is therefore advised with threat. They explode on death (It\u2019s in the name, hey) dealing Fire damage, sizable enough to kill Players if mismanaged. They must be crowd controlled (as much as possible) before they die, stepped clear from, and finished off. The Raid will usually stack when they appear (so that they\u2019re easily blown apart by AoE, including Tank Threat AoEs) and then spread after some AoE crowd control has been dropped (Frost Trap/Earthbind/Shadowfury\u2026) Guardians of Nature That\u2019s their official name. They\u2019re actually three Adds with roughly the same HP pool. They must die within a 12 seconds interval , lest they revive each other (DPS switch will be called): The Storm Lasher regularly zaps nearby enemies with Nature damage which can be shrugged off. He also casts a fairly underwhelming lightning bolt at his current target, which should be interrupted even though it\u2019s not a death sentence. He\u2019s the easiest to deal with. The Ancient Water Spirit has only one mechanic: a 2-second cast that will, if completed, charge at a faraway Player, dealing massive damage in its path (but not one-shotting in Normal Mode). This cannot be interrupted but other crowd control will work (Stuns mostly) The Snaplasher is a most peculiar mob that deals reasonable damage to his threat target, but greatly increases his melee damage as he receives damage - up to \u201cOne-Shot the Tank\u201d territory. He\u2019s easily crowd controlled by slows however. Everyone dishing threat on the Snaplasher should be wary of not pulling aggro. It\u2019ll usually be handled by a Hunter or an Offtank (taunting but not meleeing) with assistance from a DK\u2019s Chains of Ice. P2 Once 6 waves of Adds have been dealt with, Freya will enter Phase2. She will still cast Sunbeams and Lifebinder\u2019s Gifts, but has mostly one last mechanic: * Nature Bombs will be dropped on the Players\u2019 positions . After a short delay, they will explode. This is easily handled by having the Raid grouped loosely around the same spot; moving a safe distance away whenever bombs are dropped. A good landmark that we\u2019ll use is crossing a river back and forth whenever bombs are dropped. When Freya reaches 0 HP, the fight ends. Essentials Tanks Freya\u2019s Tank doesn\u2019t have much to do, and will likely pick up the Storm Lasher or the Water Spirit. Do not attempt facetanking the Snaplasher.

Hodir himself is fairly straightforward. The fight ends when he reaches 0 HP (though he technically doesn\u2019t die). Full Mechanics Rundown Biting Cold : Similarly to the last Nexus Boss, Players stack up Biting Cold whenever they are not moving . Each stack deals Frost Damage, stacking infinitely. Moving only removes one stack per check - so the longer you stand still, the more you\u2019ll have to move to remove stacks. It is assumed this damage will not be a problem if Players are moving correctly - that is, often. Icicles : Constantly through the fight, Icicles will land on spots marked with a reticle a few seconds before landing. These spots will appear directly on top of random Players. Dodging those icicles encourages you to remove your Intense Cold stacks. Icicles deal roughly 45% of a Player\u2019s HP and knock them aside. Taking two Icicles in a short row is usually a death sentence, and you should be able to never get hit by these. Flash Freeze : Both the name of enemy Adds in this fight and one of Hodir\u2019s spells. The fight begins with 5 Flash Freezes in the arena. These are actually icy tombs that imprison 5 unique friendly NPCs that will be freed on pull by breaking the Flash Freezes. These NPCs provide great boons when freed. When Hodir casts Flash Freeze (exactly every minute), those NPCs will be entombed again. This is a long cast that also causes two very large snow piles to drop from the ceiling. Similarly to Icicles, these will be marked by a large reticle on the ground. Players must move away from the landing spot of these snow piles, then must run and climb on top of them. Failing to be on the snow pile when Hodir completes his cast will cause the Player to also be entombed in a Flash Freeze that will need to be broken to allow the Player to jump back into the game. You should strive to never fail that mechanic, ever. Frozen Blows : Right after completing his Flash Freeze cast, Hodir will gain Frozen Blow for a while. While it\u2019s active, the whole Raid will take massive Frost damage every few seconds, and Hodir will convert a portion of his damage dealt to the Tank from Physical damage to Frost Damage. Freeze : Regularly cast throughout the fight on random Players. Prevents movement and must be dispelled before it causes the Player to be unable to dodge the other mechanics by movement. Essentials Tanks Solo-Tank fight. To beat Normal Mode Hodir, no movement will truly be required of you. Save your cooldowns for Frozen Blows. Do not fail the movement mechanics. Healers Use externals and Raid mitigation cooldowns during Frozen Blows. Dispel the Freeze (mostly up to the Disc Priest) Do not fail the movement mechanics. DPS On pull, specific Flash Freezes will be focused to be #1 DPS priority. The other Flash Freezes are still higher priority than Hodir. Return to these Flash Freezes and destroy them every time new ones appear right after a Flash Freeze. Use self-defensive CDs during Frozen blows. Do not fail the movement mechanics.

Each stack deals Frost Damage, stacking infinitely. Moving only removes one stack per check - so the longer you stand still, the more you\u2019ll have to move to remove stacks. It is assumed this damage will not be a problem if Players are moving correctly - that is, often. Icicles : Constantly through the fight, Icicles will land on spots marked with a reticle a few seconds before landing. These spots will appear directly on top of random Players. Dodging those icicles encourages you to remove your Intense Cold stacks. Icicles deal roughly 45% of a Player\u2019s HP and knock them aside. Taking two Icicles in a short row is usually a death sentence, and you should be able to never get hit by these. Flash Freeze : Both the name of enemy Adds in this fight and one of Hodir\u2019s spells. The fight begins with 5 Flash Freezes in the arena. These are actually icy tombs that imprison 5 unique friendly NPCs that will be freed on pull by breaking the Flash Freezes. These NPCs provide great boons when freed. When Hodir casts Flash Freeze (exactly every minute), those NPCs will be entombed again. This is a long cast that also causes two very large snow piles to drop from the ceiling. Similarly to Icicles, these will be marked by a large reticle on the ground. Players must move away from the landing spot of these snow piles, then must run and climb on top of them. Failing to be on the snow pile when Hodir completes his cast will cause the Player to also be entombed in a Flash Freeze that will need to be broken to allow the Player to jump back into the game. You should strive to never fail that mechanic, ever. Frozen Blows : Right after completing his Flash Freeze cast, Hodir will gain Frozen Blow for a while. While it\u2019s active, the whole Raid will take massive Frost damage every few seconds, and Hodir will convert a portion of his damage dealt to the Tank from Physical damage to Frost Damage. Freeze : Regularly cast throughout the fight on random Players. Prevents movement and must be dispelled before it causes the Player to be unable to dodge the other mechanics by movement.","title":"Full Mechanics Rundown"},{"location":"normal/hodir/#essentials","text":"","title":"Essentials"},{"location":"normal/hodir/#tanks","text":"Solo-Tank fight.

He will regularly cast Napalm Shell at a random Raid member, preferring Ranged. The shell affects the Player and any nearby allies (DBM will show a range radar) with a heavy DoT debuff (Fire Damage). There is enough room so that Napalm Shells should never hit more than the Player it targets. Healing two Players hit is manageable, though. The loose spread might mean some Players are out of range of most Healers. Napalm Shells looks like it\u2019s a fire AoE on the ground but actually isn\u2019t - it just chooses a Player and hits them when it lands. There is no point trying to \u201cmove out of it\u201d, the only movement needed is to fix a poor spreading. He will cast a few Plasma Blasts (2-3) on his current Tank, channeling to deal massive Fire damage over the duration of the channel. Tank cooldowns and Externals will be used here. He will cast a few Shock Blasts (2-3), a long cast that deals lethal Nature Damage once complete. Everyone should run out of it . He will drop Land Mines around himself, slightly outside of his melee range , frequently. These will only explode if stepped on. Melees should be cautious when running out of Shock Blasts, as there will surely be Mines on their way . They are dropped in a semi-random pattern, usually leaving a few gaps to escape through. Two mines worth of damage is lethal. P2 Mimiron engages the Raid in a robotic chest. No melee swings from the Boss. Instead, he constantly casts Hand Pulse, dealing Spellfire damage in a direction ( targeting a random Player and hitting everything in its direction ). Regularly Fire Novas (direct damage+DoT). Not an issue even with many Players close to him. Casts Rockets on random Players, preferring Ranged. The landing spot is marked in a bright red, and should be moved out of A.S.A.P. Lethal damage. Casts Laser Barrage : first he\u2019ll wind up in a direction, leaving time for the Players to run to the sides. Once done winding up, he\u2019ll constantly deal lethal damage in the direction he\u2019s firing, slowly rotating in the process. Hand Pulse is disabled during the barrage but will resume instantly once the Barrage is complete. P3 Mimiron will be flying in a robotic head (\u201c_Aerial Command Unit__\u201d). He\u2019s targetable but cannot be reached by melee sources. Melees will instead be dealing with Adds on the ground, not only to relieve the Raid but also to bring down the flying head. Plasma Ball : The Head doesn\u2019t melee but instead constantly fires every 2 seconds for 8k-10k worth of magic damage on its current threat target. Can be healed through as long as threat doesn\u2019t constantly bounces between Warlocks - better handled by having one Demolock (because of Soul Link) weaving a few Searing Pains to out-threat everyone. Can also be repeatedly taunted by a Tank. If the threat target moves out of range the head will follow along. It is otherwise immobile. Bomb Bot : the Head drops a Bomb Bot NPC right below its current position. It has low health and should be killed from range as it will detonate if it reaches its threat target. Chains of Ice and other CC work here. Assault Bot : Tanky Adds that will spawn on locations marked by a red beam (the beam itself does nothing). Deal high melee damage (enough to clap clothes) and can root the Tank (which can be dispelled). When Assault Bots die they drop an item that can be picked up (depending on loot rules, but usually anyone).

This results in a selection of mechanics encountered previously: The Bottom (\u201cTank\u201d) melees his current Tank, can move after his current Tank (moving the bottom causing the whole robot to move), casts Shock Blasts (lethal) and lays Landmines (near-lethal). The Middle (\u201cChest\u201d) fires Hand Pulses, launches Rockets (lethal) and will cast 1-2 Laser Barrages that will need to be moved out of. The Top (\u201cHead\u201d) casts Plasma Balls at his current threat target. No Adds will be involved in this Phase. Mechanics from previous phases that aren\u2019t mentioned right above will not be present Additionally, these three parts must be destroyed within 15 seconds of each other. If not, they will all be healed for 50% max HP. Essentials Tanks Phase1: Use cooldowns on Plasma Blast and do not facetank Shock Blast . Do not trigger Landmines when running from Shock Blast. Phase2: Avoid Barrages. Phase3: Pick up all the Adds you can, but do not cause Bomb Bots to blow people up if they reach you. Use the item dropped by the Assault Bots below the Head if you loot it. Phase4: Do not facetank Shock Blast . Do not trigger Landmines when running from Shock Blast. Avoid Barrages. Healers Phase1: Stay spread and prioritize heals on Napalm Shells and Plasma Blasts. Phase2: Avoid Barrages and pump AoE Heals. Run out of the Rocket landing zones. Phase3: Heal the target of the Head ( your UI should reflect who has threat from something ) and the Tank. Stay out of Bomb Bots and Assault Bots. Phase4: Avoid Rockets, Barrages and heal both the Tank and the Head\u2019s target. DPS Phase1: Do not facetank Shock Blast . Do not trigger Landmines when running from Shock Blast. Ranged must stay spread. Phase2: Avoid Barrage and Rockets. Phase3: Mind your threat on Bomb Bots and Assault Bots. Ranged can stay on the Head for the whole Phase, (might be up to change for Hard Mode) but multidotting the Assault Bot is welcome.

The first Phase also splits the Raid in two groups that will have two very different battles to deal with: They will be referred to as the \u201cArena\u201d group/room and the \u201cGauntlet/Tunnel\u201d group/room. Once the Gauntlet group finishes fighting through a passage that allows them to reach Thorim, dealing any threat to him will cause him to jump down into the Arena, and Phase2 will begin. Gauntlet Players are then also free to jump down to return to the Arena, which is where the pull happens. Players should mostly be concerned about their survivability. Full Mechanics Rundown P1: Arena Quite a few Adds will be present before the pull happens. They must be killed to proceed, and the timer for the fight actually only starts once they\u2019re dead and Thorim gets pissed. These Adds aren\u2019t very threatening or special, aside from a giant worm that needs to be faced away from the Raid. Players that are assigned to remain in the Arena should do a loose spread whenever possible, as Thorim will regularly stun a Player (unavoidable), and cause that Player plus anyone nearby to take Nature damage and increasing their spell casting time by 75% (for that reason, Arena will mostly be Melee DPS and Hunters). Spreading against this mechanic isn\u2019t easy, as the pillars around the arena will sometimes activate and spout lightning at Players that have moved towards them. Moving away from the source of the lightning will simply fix the problem, and the damage shouldn\u2019t cause a death if reacted to. Adds will regularly spawn and enter the Arena. There are four types of them: Commoners, a swarm of fairly weak Adds. They interrupt their target, so the Tank should ensure Healers do not pull threat off them. Champions , dangerous Adds that are similar to Razorscale\u2019s Sentinels as they are defined by their deadly Whirlwind . They can also Charge targets outside their melee range, making them extremely dangerous and the #1 DPS Priority . They can be Disarmed on Warmane. Warbringers , melee Adds that deal high tank damage and buff their allies with a passive Aura. Be wary of pulling Threat on them. May be Mind Controlled to provide that Buff to the Raid Group instead (and to deal acceptable damage). They do not need to be focused as long as they\u2019re in low numbers and the Tank isn\u2019t overwhelmed. Evokers, who commonly spawn with Warbringers (but combinations with Champions also happen) are Casters who do not engage in melee (and deal low melee damage if silenced). They can disrupt the Arena group greatly by shielding, damaging, and buffing themselves to be immune to interrupts. Offensive dispels and interrupts are ideal against them, making Enhancement Shaman the perfect pick. They are second in Priority behind Champions. Adds will spawn until Phase2 begins . Therefore, Arena group must survive the war of attrition until Gauntlet group completes their task. P1: Gauntlet Once the starting Adds are dead, a Lever will become clickable to the left of the Arena. Maintaining the \u201ccast\u201d to open it will open the door to the Gauntlet. The first part of the Gauntlet will contain Adds and a Mini-Boss at the back of the room. This mini-Boss will blast the room with a forward-moving fire AoE. He may blast either half of the room (left or right), and chooses between the two halves randomly. The Gauntlet group should be wary of that and constantly move to whichever half of the room is safe. Getting hit by the AoE should not be a one-shot but is still heavy damage that can get out of control. It seems getting hit by the AoE while edging in the center of the room also causes double damage (likely killing the Player). Fire Aura Mastery and DSacs are useful here. Those AOEs cease when the Mini-Boss is engaged in combat ( though he will complete his last AoE before starting to fight ). The Iron Ring Guards (Adds) on the path to the Mini-Boss deal heavy damage to the Tank and can stun him (causing even further damage by preventing him to dodge/parry), and apply a heavy Bleed effect that must be healed to 100% HP to be removed. Hand of Sacrifice is very much worth it, as are other externals and tank cooldowns. The Guards also Cleave for heavy damage and should be faced away from the Raid even when moving away from AoEs. An Acolyte will also assist the Guards with heals and Smites, and should be killed first . He may cast a powerful Renew on himself or the Guards which must be Dispelled . Mini-Boss(Runic Colossus), once engaged, has a few rules which the Gauntlet group must follow: All Players must be in melee range , lest the Mini-Boss will Charge them repeatedly; All Players should be behind him ; At 50% HP, he\u2019ll shield himself, taking reduced damage and reflecting (some) of the incoming Physical damage. Attention is required for any dual-wielders in here. Once the Mini-Boss dies, the path behind him will open. The second section involves moving upstairs. There will be more Acolytes ( to kick, dispel, and focus ) and Iron Honor Guards who deal less Tank damage but still Cleave hard, and Hamstring the Tank to slow the progression (easily fixed by two rotating Hands of Freedom, usually ProtPal + HPal). As soon as the group sets foot on the first stair, Iron Honor Guards will regularly spawn from upstairs , right below the second Mini-Boss. These respawns aren\u2019t overwhelming but might be a problem if the Mini-Boss is engaged right after a respawn. On pull, the Mini-Boss(Ancient Rune Giant) will greatly buff any remaining Adds (Acolytes and Honor Guards). This isn\u2019t a death sentence if 1-2 Adds remain but will roughen up the fight. Buffed Adds should definitely be disposed of before moving onto the Mini-Boss himself. The Mini-Boss will regularly shove around himself for moderate damage+knockback, and will regularly mark a Player with a rune (DBM will mark it as Skull) that will cause high fire damage around the Player after a delay and prevent that Player from moving. As long as Players move out of marked Players, this damage shouldn\u2019t be a problem, but slacking on that movement can overwhelm Healers. Once the Mini-Boss dies, the path further opens to Thorim. The last section has no enemies to kill but instead will trap Players (Not killing them, but incapacitating them for a long while) that move in the large circles in the center of the path. Simply stick to the side walls and no trouble will happen. Thorim is at the end of the path and is targetable. Any hostile action towards him will initiate Phase2. It is recommended to let the Gauntlet group drop down into the Arena and let one last Player hit Thorim before jumping down. P2: Thorin Thorim doesn\u2019t swing very hard but still features a soft-enrage mechanic where he builds up attack speed and damage dealt over the minutes he remains alive. He also has a hard enrage which should not be reached in Normal Mode as he also has reduced health. Tanks should save cooldowns for later. Speaking of swings, he will regularly do an Unbalancing Strike at the Tank, dealing moderate damage (scaling with how much soft-enraged he is) and massively debuffing the Tank\u2019s Defense. Regular Tank swaps will fix it , as this debuff doesn\u2019t stack and is shorter than the frequency at which he performs this move. Regularly, the pillars around the edge of the Arena will light up and create a thin strand of lightning towards Thorim (Who should be tanked in the middle of the room, but for clarity, know it\u2019ll be linked to Thorim). This thread doesn\u2019t deal damage by itself but should be moved out of A.S.A.P: After a few seconds, Thorim will blast lightning in the direction of the thread, dealing massive damage to anyone still remaining in the direction. This is a large cone, much larger than the strand of lightning that indicates the upcoming damage. It can one-shot depending on your spec and Thorim\u2019s soft enrage. In Hard Mode it will one-shot nearly always, so practice dodging it. Thorim also regularly casts Chain Lightning , which ramps up with bounces rather than ramping down. Ranged Players will be in several groups of 2, possibly 3, and Melee DPS will be split in 3 different groups (not counting the Tank group). This is a significant danger that can one-shot Players, not a healing check. You must work on your positioning, even in Normal Mode, to never create chains that can one-shot other Players. Essentials Tanks Arena Tank: No cooldowns required unless overwhelmed, the focus is on hreat generation. Gauntlet Tank: use cooldowns for the first few pulls, the rest is easier. Face the first Mini-Boss away , towards the door behind him. Thorim: Stay stacked with other Tanks and taunt swap when Unbalancing Strike lands. Save cooldowns for execute (where Thorim will be more soft-enraged). Healers Arena: Do a slight spread, move away from lightning sources, and try to keep your threat low. Gauntlet: pump heals and externals on the first 2 packs. Move left and right to avoid the fire AoEs. Move into melee range of the first Mini-Boss. Thorim: Respect the positioning for Chain Lightnings, move out of Lightning Charges (the fine threads on the ground). DPS Arena: Respect the priority order and watch your threat. Dispel and interrupt the Evokers if your class allows it. Stay away from Champions if they cannot be bursted before Whirlwind. Gauntlet: Never be in front of \u201cphysical\u201d mobs (Guards, Honor Guards) and focus+dispel+interrupt Acolytes. Move left and right to avoid the fire AoEs. Move into melee range of the first Mini-Boss. Stay spread on the second Mini-Boss.

Full Mechanics Rundown Vezax is flat out Immune to Taunts . It is recommended to not pull threat if you\u2019re not a Tank. Once pulled, he will disable ALL MANA REGENERATION . That is MP5/Spirit from Items, from your base character, from potions, from Talents (e.g HPal\u2019s Illumination), from Spells (e.g Divine Plea), everything. The only exceptions are Retribution and Enhancement getting a very minor help to sustain their mana, lest they would be utterly useless and benched, which wouldn\u2019t be nice. That aura also reduces melee attack speed by 20%, for reasons. Due to this mechanic I encourage all Healers (MS and OS) to not destroy their old gear and to look after gear that has no MP5/Spirit. Paladins especially have a brilliant selection of items that give Haste+Crit, which is rarer on Cloth/Leather. Those specific items can be gemmed/enchanted differently, for instance with Spell Power gems on a HPal set since Intellect won\u2019t be of much use. Similarly, a specialized Talent offspec/respec can be very handy. You can actually regenerate mana in Normal Mode. \u201cSaronite Vapor\u201d Adds will float around the room. They have low HP and are easily killed by cleave. When killed, they drop a green puddle below them. Staying in the green puddle will regenerate Mana at the cost of their Health , doubling up for every 2 seconds remained in the puddle. The first tick is 100 mana at the cost of 200 health, the second 200mana/400hp, then 400mana/800hp, etc. This Health loss can kill you , so don\u2019t die, especially since there are no mechanics to prevent movement (would be a great excuse). Healers should not rely on this mechanic, since it's disabled in Hard Mode. He will regularly cast Shadow Crash at a random Player, preferring Ranged (in this case it is vital to have enough Ranged Players). The Shadow Crash is a very slow-moving projectile but deals AoE high damage (60-80% HP) on impact, knocks any targets hit around, and leave a black puddle that grants the following to Players on it: +100% Magic Damage dealt +100% Casting Speed Mana Costs -75% Healing Done -75% In other words, this is RangedDPS Heaven. They will have to constantly dodge the regular Shadow Crashes , move back in to benefit the massive buff , rinse and repeat. As you\u2019d expect this is a huge DPS gain in spite of the movement, so extreme caution should be paid to not pull threat off the (untauntable) Boss. He will sometimes (45s cd) apply a debuff called Mark of the Faceless on a random Player, preferring Ranged .

It is recommended to not pull threat if you\u2019re not a Tank. Once pulled, he will disable ALL MANA REGENERATION . That is MP5/Spirit from Items, from your base character, from potions, from Talents (e.g HPal\u2019s Illumination), from Spells (e.g Divine Plea), everything. The only exceptions are Retribution and Enhancement getting a very minor help to sustain their mana, lest they would be utterly useless and benched, which wouldn\u2019t be nice. That aura also reduces melee attack speed by 20%, for reasons. Due to this mechanic I encourage all Healers (MS and OS) to not destroy their old gear and to look after gear that has no MP5/Spirit. Paladins especially have a brilliant selection of items that give Haste+Crit, which is rarer on Cloth/Leather. Those specific items can be gemmed/enchanted differently, for instance with Spell Power gems on a HPal set since Intellect won\u2019t be of much use. Similarly, a specialized Talent offspec/respec can be very handy. You can actually regenerate mana in Normal Mode. \u201cSaronite Vapor\u201d Adds will float around the room. They have low HP and are easily killed by cleave. When killed, they drop a green puddle below them. Staying in the green puddle will regenerate Mana at the cost of their Health , doubling up for every 2 seconds remained in the puddle. The first tick is 100 mana at the cost of 200 health, the second 200mana/400hp, then 400mana/800hp, etc. This Health loss can kill you , so don\u2019t die, especially since there are no mechanics to prevent movement (would be a great excuse). Healers should not rely on this mechanic, since it's disabled in Hard Mode. He will regularly cast Shadow Crash at a random Player, preferring Ranged (in this case it is vital to have enough Ranged Players). The Shadow Crash is a very slow-moving projectile but deals AoE high damage (60-80% HP) on impact, knocks any targets hit around, and leave a black puddle that grants the following to Players on it: +100% Magic Damage dealt +100% Casting Speed Mana Costs -75% Healing Done -75% In other words, this is RangedDPS Heaven. They will have to constantly dodge the regular Shadow Crashes , move back in to benefit the massive buff , rinse and repeat. As you\u2019d expect this is a huge DPS gain in spite of the movement, so extreme caution should be paid to not pull threat off the (untauntable) Boss. He will sometimes (45s cd) apply a debuff called Mark of the Faceless on a random Player, preferring Ranged .

They must prealably be talked to, to activate their help. This cannot be undone. Each Keeper provides his own, large Buff to stats on the Players (which never expires), and provides a useful ability to change the fight: Mimiron grants +10% Damage dealt and +20% movement speed. He will also massively reduce the casting speed of enemy Adds in Phase2 (will be detailed later) Hodir grants +10% Damage dealt and -20% Damage taken. He also will prevent some Player deaths by encasing them in an ice block, saving their life. This has a cooldown and the Player may \u201c/cancelaura Flash Freeze\u201d if he\u2019s safe and wishes to exit the ice block early. Thorim grants +10% Damage dealt and +20% max HP. He will also regularly execute Adds in Phase3, that would otherwise be immortal, if they reach low HP. Freya will grant +10% Damage dealt and +20% Healing received. She will also enable 4 Sanity Wells in the corners of the room, large green beams that reduce damage dealt while standing in it but restore Sanity. Sanity Sanity is a \u201cresource\u201d that will be displayed in a form of a Debuff on your UI . It goes from 100 to 0. The only direct effect it has is that if you reach 0 Sanity you will be mind-controlled by Yogg-Saron, gaining massively increased stats and becoming very mean to your Raid. The Mind-Control will never be undone including by Battle Rez, Soulstone, and Ankh (So do not do any of these on a previous Mindcontrolled Player/on yourself if mindcontrolled). It is not necessarily a wipe sentence but shows you fucked up. So, back to Freya\u2019s Sanity Wells: Simply stand on it to regenerate 20 sanity every 2 seconds. That\u2019s it. Very fast, safe, and available in all Phases of the fight. When a Boss\u2019 mechanics interacts with Sanity it\u2019ll be reminded in the writeup. In general, you can assume the following: All damage that is avoidable in Phase2 and 3 will likely also have a small damage to Sanity. P1 Yogg will pretend to be Sara. To snap him back to his reasonable self, we have to damage Sara in the middle of the room, but it\u2019s a friendly NPC. What to do? Ominous Clouds will float around the room. Their path isn\u2019t random: They are placed on concentric circles and turn clockwise or counterclockwise . Stepping on a cloud will cause a Guardian of Yogg-Saron to appear after a few seconds. Guardians of Yogg-Saron also spawn over time regardless of Cloud-stepping experiences. Guardians of Yogg-Saron do moderate melee damage (clothies beware) and cast Shadow Volleys (high damage, and reduce healing recieved) which should always be interrupted . When they die, they also instantly cause a Shadow Nova , dealing heavy but healable damage (as long as not too many die at the same time). Apparently Silencing the Guardians or Interrupting a Shadow Volley before they die prevents them from doing a Shadow Nova, which is probably an exploit and is not necessary anyway. The Shadow Nova damages Sara (if in range) for 12.5% max HP. So, bring 8 Adds to the middle, kill them here, and Phase2 begins. Sounds great, but: Sara herself will cast a few spells that might cause trouble: Sara\u2019s Fervor is a debuff that increases a Player\u2019s Damage by 20% but causes him to take +100% Damage. This might be enough to cause the Player to be one-shot by a Shadow Nova when an Add dies. The Player should move out of the stacked Raid while ensuring to not step on clouds. Daddy Hodir might save you from the one-shot but this is necessary practice for Hard Mode. Sara\u2019s Blessing is a debuff that causes 60K Shadow Damage over 20 seconds. In itself it\u2019s mostly harmless and healable through, but can stack with Sara\u2019s Fervor, becoming near-lethal damage when added on top of Shadow Novas . Players should use defensive cooldowns like Anti-Magic Shell or Ice Block if receiving both debuffs. Sara\u2019s Anger is used on Guardians of Yogg-Saron rather than Players and increases their melee damage per swing by 12000. Unremarkable. P2 Transition : The Ominous Clouds will disappear but Adds will remain, usually 1 + 1 extra that is about to spawn. Simply pull the Raid out of the center and keep killing the Adds the same way. Yogg will show up in the center of the room (what once was a large puddle of saronite), pushing Players away if they try staying too close to his godly corpulence. He\u2019s immune to damage in this Phase. Now, onto Phase2 itself: As soon as Phase2 begins, several Tentacle Adds will spawn all around the room in random patterns. More Tentacles will also continuously spawn until the Raid manages to push Phase3. They are all stationary. The three types of Tentacles are the following: Corruptor Tentacles constantly cast Debuffs at random Players. All their casts can be Interrupted , and Mimiron\u2019s presence causes them to cast 4x slower. There are 4 different debuffs (Curse, Poison, Magic, Disease) and all should be dispelled as soon as noticed on your UI. Ranked in order of danger: Disease (regularly stuns) > Magic (heavy slow) > Poison (HP/Mana DoT) > Curse (Curse of Doom, 12s duration) Corruptor Tentacles are the lowest priority to be killed among the 3 types. Crusher Tentacles reduce the Raid\u2019s Damage by 20% (for each Crusher, can stack) as long as they are not being hit by melee swings. However, they also can one-shot with their melee swings (if any Player is in melee range). It is not necessary for melees to risk their lives on the Crushers, the Ranged DPS can take care of them. All Paladins should be using Judgements on Crusher Tentacles whenever it\u2019s up, as it is classified as a melee attack and will interrupt Diminish Power (the -20% Damage reduction) Crushers are the second in priority to be killed. Constrictor Tentacle will spawn near a Player and grab it, preventing its movement and causing heavy Physical damage over time. It has fairly low HP and should be focus-fired instantly when it spawns. Immunity effects like Iceblock, Bubble and Hand of Protection should also free the grabbed Player - seemed inconsistent last season. Sara becomes a very attractive Val\u2019kyr, proving Yogg has schizophrenia. She will cast the following spells to disrupt the Raid, ranked from most dangerous to least: Death Ray : Several lasers firing in semi-random patterns, usually edging towards Players. Two/three ticks are lethal and they tick very fast, thus should be stood away from as much as possible. Malady of the Mind : Cast on a random Player and behaves as a Warlock\u2019s Death Coil. At the end of the effect, it will bounce to a nearby Player(if any is nearby). Everyone should be wary of that and move away from any Malady\u2019d Player, which will be marked with Skull by DBM. The Malady deals low damage but reduces Sanity. Brain Link : Two Players will be bound by a link that forces them to go close to each other. If the Players are over 20 yards away from each other they will take damage and lose Sanity. The link will be red if that is the case. Psychosis: Random unavoidable damage on a Player, also reducing Sanity. Induce Madness : One minute after transition, this mechanic will begin on a cycle. Every time Induce Madness is cast, 10 Portals will open around Yogg . Their positions are fixed and they will be assigned to Players. Those Players should be ready in front of their assigned portal before they\u2019re active. Clicking on the Portal leads to a Brain Room , of which three are possible. The layout changes but the same rules apply: The Players in the Brain Room must move to eutral NPCs and destroy them . They will reflect % of incoming damage , justifying the presence of a Healer among the 10 Players. While doing so, they must avoid facing , (their character, not the camera\u2026) as much as possible, the light-purple laughing skulls . Facing them causes damage and reduces Sanity. Once all NPCs have been destroyed the laughing skulls will be removed and a wall of the room will be removed. Proceed through it to find the Brain of Yogg-Saron , which is the actual caster of Induce Madness. The Brain can be damaged, doesn\u2019t fight back in any way, and all damage done to the Brain will carry over to Yogg himself . Damaging the Brain is the only way to make Phase3 happen. As long as the Brain is exposed, all Tentacles will be stunned and no more will spawn. Near the Brain some Portals will allow the trip back to the main room. Should any Player remain in the Brain Room when Induce Madness completes casting (It\u2019s a 60s cast), they will instantly be lowered to 0 Sanity and be Mind Controlled. The Brain Room should be left with a generous 2-3 seconds remaining before the end. 30 seconds after Induce Madness completes, a new Induce Madness will be cast and Portals will open, rinse and repeat. Once Yogg-Saron reaches 30% HP due to Brain damage (heh), Phase3 begins. P3 Yogg decides to stop messing about and remembers he\u2019s supposed to be a God of Death and not of Tentacles of Brains, and engages the Raid directly. He\u2019s still stationary and will still bump out any Players in him. He does not melee. Leftover Tentacles from Phase2 will not be removed and should either be dealt with or ignored, at the discretion of the RL. He will cast Lunatic Gaze extremely frequently on a fixed cooldown. Anytime Lunatic Gaze is being channeled, any Player that faces towards Yogg will take damage and lose a large amount of Sanity , every second. While Lunatic Gaze isn\u2019t being cast, it\u2019s back to normal. Immortal Guardians will spawn very frequently, in various corners of the room, sometimes very close to Players. They deal high melee damage (enough to OS a clothie) and should be picked up A.S.A.P. However, they deal less damage (and become smaller) as their %HP is lowered. They will attempt to cast Drain Life to heal back up (and even when full HP), which should be interrupted . As mentioned earlier, the Immortal Guardians are Immortal, but Uncle Thorim got your back and out-mortals them by finishing them off when they reach 1% HP. Yogg-Saron will sometimes apply Shadow Beacon to a random Immortal Guardian. After a few seconds, the Shadow Beacon, if still alive, will apply a huge Heal over Time to its nearby allies - either other Immortal Guardians or Yogg-Saron. This is not a concern in Normal Mode and will be expanded upon in the Hard Mode section. Strategy Image Reference Essentials Tanks P1 Pick up Adds and keep them in the center of the room.

DPS P1 Interrupt Adds anytime and stay stacked with the Raid. P2 Ranged on Crushers, Melees on Corruptors with Interrupts. Constrictors instantly become #1 priority when they spawn. Brain Room saves cooldowns for the Brain itself and must regenerate their Sanity in the Sanity Well if needed. P3 Melees should cleave Adds and only turn on Yogg-Saron if no Adds remain. Ranged should always be on Yogg-Saron unless Adds start overwhelming the Raid. Neither DPS should be facing Yogg more than 1 tick of Lunatic Gaze.

Unremarkable.","title":"P1"},{"location":"normal/yogg/#p2","text":"Transition : The Ominous Clouds will disappear but Adds will remain, usually 1 + 1 extra that is about to spawn. Simply pull the Raid out of the center and keep killing the Adds the same way. Yogg will show up in the center of the room (what once was a large puddle of saronite), pushing Players away if they try staying too close to his godly corpulence. He\u2019s immune to damage in this Phase. Now, onto Phase2 itself: As soon as Phase2 begins, several Tentacle Adds will spawn all around the room in random patterns. More Tentacles will also continuously spawn until the Raid manages to push Phase3. They are all stationary. The three types of Tentacles are the following: Corruptor Tentacles constantly cast Debuffs at random Players. All their casts can be Interrupted , and Mimiron\u2019s presence causes them to cast 4x slower. There are 4 different debuffs (Curse, Poison, Magic, Disease) and all should be dispelled as soon as noticed on your UI. Ranked in order of danger: Disease (regularly stuns) > Magic (heavy slow) > Poison (HP/Mana DoT) > Curse (Curse of Doom, 12s duration) Corruptor Tentacles are the lowest priority to be killed among the 3 types. Crusher Tentacles reduce the Raid\u2019s Damage by 20% (for each Crusher, can stack) as long as they are not being hit by melee swings. However, they also can one-shot with their melee swings (if any Player is in melee range). It is not necessary for melees to risk their lives on the Crushers, the Ranged DPS can take care of them. All Paladins should be using Judgements on Crusher Tentacles whenever it\u2019s up, as it is classified as a melee attack and will interrupt Diminish Power (the -20% Damage reduction) Crushers are the second in priority to be killed. Constrictor Tentacle will spawn near a Player and grab it, preventing its movement and causing heavy Physical damage over time. It has fairly low HP and should be focus-fired instantly when it spawns. Immunity effects like Iceblock, Bubble and Hand of Protection should also free the grabbed Player - seemed inconsistent last season. Sara becomes a very attractive Val\u2019kyr, proving Yogg has schizophrenia. She will cast the following spells to disrupt the Raid, ranked from most dangerous to least: Death Ray : Several lasers firing in semi-random patterns, usually edging towards Players. Two/three ticks are lethal and they tick very fast, thus should be stood away from as much as possible. Malady of the Mind : Cast on a random Player and behaves as a Warlock\u2019s Death Coil. At the end of the effect, it will bounce to a nearby Player(if any is nearby). Everyone should be wary of that and move away from any Malady\u2019d Player, which will be marked with Skull by DBM. The Malady deals low damage but reduces Sanity. Brain Link : Two Players will be bound by a link that forces them to go close to each other. If the Players are over 20 yards away from each other they will take damage and lose Sanity. The link will be red if that is the case. Psychosis: Random unavoidable damage on a Player, also reducing Sanity. Induce Madness : One minute after transition, this mechanic will begin on a cycle. Every time Induce Madness is cast, 10 Portals will open around Yogg . Their positions are fixed and they will be assigned to Players. Those Players should be ready in front of their assigned portal before they\u2019re active. Clicking on the Portal leads to a Brain Room , of which three are possible. The layout changes but the same rules apply: The Players in the Brain Room must move to eutral NPCs and destroy them . They will reflect % of incoming damage , justifying the presence of a Healer among the 10 Players. While doing so, they must avoid facing , (their character, not the camera\u2026) as much as possible, the light-purple laughing skulls . Facing them causes damage and reduces Sanity. Once all NPCs have been destroyed the laughing skulls will be removed and a wall of the room will be removed. Proceed through it to find the Brain of Yogg-Saron , which is the actual caster of Induce Madness. The Brain can be damaged, doesn\u2019t fight back in any way, and all damage done to the Brain will carry over to Yogg himself . Damaging the Brain is the only way to make Phase3 happen. As long as the Brain is exposed, all Tentacles will be stunned and no more will spawn. Near the Brain some Portals will allow the trip back to the main room. Should any Player remain in the Brain Room when Induce Madness completes casting (It\u2019s a 60s cast), they will instantly be lowered to 0 Sanity and be Mind Controlled. The Brain Room should be left with a generous 2-3 seconds remaining before the end. 30 seconds after Induce Madness completes, a new Induce Madness will be cast and Portals will open, rinse and repeat. Once Yogg-Saron reaches 30% HP due to Brain damage (heh), Phase3 begins.","title":"P2"},{"location":"normal/yogg/#p3","text":"Yogg decides to stop messing about and remembers he\u2019s supposed to be a God of Death and not of Tentacles of Brains, and engages the Raid directly. He\u2019s still stationary and will still bump out any Players in him. He does not melee. Leftover Tentacles from Phase2 will not be removed and should either be dealt with or ignored, at the discretion of the RL. He will cast Lunatic Gaze extremely frequently on a fixed cooldown. Anytime Lunatic Gaze is being channeled, any Player that faces towards Yogg will take damage and lose a large amount of Sanity , every second. While Lunatic Gaze isn\u2019t being cast, it\u2019s back to normal. Immortal Guardians will spawn very frequently, in various corners of the room, sometimes very close to Players. They deal high melee damage (enough to OS a clothie) and should be picked up A.S.A.P. However, they deal less damage (and become smaller) as their %HP is lowered. They will attempt to cast Drain Life to heal back up (and even when full HP), which should be interrupted . As mentioned earlier, the Immortal Guardians are Immortal, but Uncle Thorim got your back and out-mortals them by finishing them off when they reach 1% HP. Yogg-Saron will sometimes apply Shadow Beacon to a random Immortal Guardian. After a few seconds, the Shadow Beacon, if still alive, will apply a huge Heal over Time to its nearby allies - either other Immortal Guardians or Yogg-Saron.

Doing so completes a key that will be usable any week (and in both 10 and 25) to open the door to Algalon. It can be accessed as early as after XT-002\u2019s fight. Once Algalon is pulled for the first time of the week, a 1-hour timer begins. Algalon will instantly vanish once the timer runs out, including if during a fight, leaving for the whole week. Technically Azeroth gets destroyed if he leaves but don\u2019t worry about that too much. Slacking between pulls is therefore extremely ill-advised. The fight is fairly short so even one minute can mean the difference between one more pull and having to Raid Off. Algalon has two Phases, of which the second is fairly short and somewhat a simplified P1. You may not relax and expect less reading than Yogg. Algalon is, all in all, a fat gear/performance check, and the burden of the strat is mostly on the Tanks. Full Mechanics Rundown Algalon deals massive Tank damage , like real massive, one might even call it Supermassive. He dual wields, has high damage per swing, also uses Quantum Strike very frequently, which is sort-of a Sinister Strike (instant melee damage with no other effects). Healers will obviously be under pressure to keep the Tanks full nonstop, pre-cast heals even on 100% HP tanks and use externals just because. Tanks will weave cooldowns anytime they wish. Speaking of Tanks, Algalon also frequently applies a Phase Punch , dealing moderate damage and applying a stack. If a Tank reaches 5 stacks he will disappear to the Shadow Realm , which doesn\u2019t mean death but will cause Algalon to simply switch threat to the #2. The Tanks should simply taunt swap at 3 or 4 and ensure they can remove their stacks (45s duration) without receiving threat again. Algalon will cast a few Cosmic Smashes through the fight. This behaves similarly to several Shadow Fissures on random Players which will need to be moved out of . Can target the Tank. Players still take damage when the Cosmic Smash lands after the delay, scaling down with how far they are . Unlike the Shadow Fissures, the Cosmic Smash doesn\u2019t instantly kill but instead deals very heavy damage and knocks up in the air, causing death if unable to cancel the fall damage. Cosmic Smashes obviously will simply need to be moved out of . Their damage (when moved out of) is fairly low but can actually add up to be lethal with other mechanics . Algalon will summon 4 Collapsing Stars , roughly in the 4 corners of the room. These do nothing of their own but will need to be killed to survive the rest of the fight. They have low HP and can be dealt with by a single assigned DPS . When they die, they deal massive, Raid-wide Shadow Damage . DSacs and Shadow AMs (rotating) will be mandatory to survive the encounter. The damage is so high we might need Mages to respec to some points in Magic Absorption . Fixing this damage fast enough to kill enough Stars is the second priority for Healers . When the Stars die, they also leave a Black Hole that teleports to the Shadow Realm if stood on . Everyone should stay clear of Stars that are currently being killed. They wander around but otherwise do not follow anyone. Stars also lose some Health over time and thus cannot be ignored, as they would uncontrollably all explode at once (or too fast, at least). There can be 3 waves of Collapsing Stars, preferably 2, before P2 is enabled. Algalon will summon Living Constellations . Unlike Stars, these have a normal Threat table and will follow their target . They do not melee swing but instead regularly cast Arcane Barrage at random Players, dealing moderate damage but enough to be lethal if combined with a Star Explosion and/or a Cosmic Smash . The Constellations realistically cannot be DPS\u2019d and should not. Instead, they disappear when coming in contact with the Black Holes left by the Stars upon death, \u201cclosing\u201d the portal therein . The ground becomes safe again and the Constellation stops damaging the Raid. There are several Constellations and they should be used to close as many Portals as possible, except one (see Big Bang below). Every 90 seconds Algalon will cast Big Bang , which does not create life as it should but instead obliterates it. The Raid\u2019s desire to not die should drive them to enter a Black Hole/Portal to the Shadow Realm before the Big Bang cast is complete . Be mindful the Portal should be entered 2-3 seconds before Big Bang is done, rather than later , or you\u2019ll be locked out from entering. Algalon will hard-enrage if all Players leave to the Shadow Realm . Therefore, one brave Shadow Priest will stay behind and use Dispersion to let the fight go on. Tanks can survive with cooldowns but they are better used during the actual fight. Shadow Realm : This is how the Shadow Realm behaves for the whole fight, but obviously this applies mostly to entrances to it due to Big Bang. The Shadow Realm doesn\u2019t really have much to offer. There will be Dark Matter Adds that merely swing at their current threat target - they aren\u2019t very dangerous but can overwhelm a single, non-Tank Player . Leaving the Shadow Realm is automatic after a few seconds . It does not depend on the completion of the Big Bang. Therefore a Tank (usually the Offtank that was leading the Constellations to the Black Holes) should ensure he jumps in first and early. When you leave the Shadow Realm, you will appear on the same spot in the \u201cMain Room\u201d as the one you stood upon in the Shadow Realm . If that spot is a Black Hole, then off you go to another trip to the Shadow Realm. This is bad and should be avoided by having the general rule of running to the center of the room whenever in the Shadow Realm (assuming there are no Black Holes in the center). This rule will be useful for P2. The fight will usually go like this: Pull -> Stars and Constellations -> Big Bang -> Stars and Constellations -> Big Bang -> Stars and Constellations appear but P2 is pushed so Adds are ignored. P2, indeed, is pushed when Algalon reaches 20% HP. When he does, all Black Holes will be closed, and all Stars and Constellations will safely disappear. No more of these will spawn. The Raid must move to the center of the room before he is Phased , as Algalon will also instantly place 4 stationary Black Holes that cannot be closed (having Players on top of them would be bad!). These Black Holes will spawn Dark Matter Adds (same as the ones in Shadow Realm) that can mostly be ignored and offtanked. Algalon will continue to cast Cosmic Smash . With the reduced room to maneuver extra caution should be paid to spot them and move out. Algalon will, in all likeliness, cast one more Big Bang before the fight ends. The Black Holes are nearby and reaching them should be no trouble. As advised, the Shadow Realm Players should move back to the center of the room to ensure they do not instantly get ported back in. Algalon seems to always Cosmic Smash after that last Big Bang, and the particles will be hard to see upon leaving the Shadow Realm. Players should move the hell out of the center since it is assumed all Players will be in the center, and thus that the Cosmic Smashes will target the center. Casualties will be accepted here . Upon reaching near-death Algalon will end the encounter and award loot to us pitiful mortals. Essentials Tanks Use cooldowns whenever you\u2019re tanking Algalon and a star is about to die (Algalon himself deals somewhat consistently high damage so you might as well use your CDs when a bit more damage will be caused by the Star). When Big Bang is coming up soon, Algalon should be moved slightly close to the last Black Hole, so that the Raid may do a few seconds worth of DPS before leaving safely. Obviously, you gotta get in too unless otherwise specified. While baiting Constellations into Black Holes watch your movement to not enter the Black Hole . HPals really should be allowed to use Righteous Fury on this fight so keep in mind you\u2019ll likely have to taunt it off them . Taunt swap depending on the situation. Sometimes swapping at 2 is OK depending on which classes the tanks are, their cooldowns, etc. Be careful on the Tank swap as Algalon seems to have volatile threat and sometimes returns to the previous Tank because of the DOTs he might have. Never lead a Constellation into the last Black Hole that the Raid wants to use to enter the Shadow Realm. If you find yourself in such a situation where a Constellation sticks to you during a Big Bang, you must be the last to enter in the Black Hole. (as moving into the Black Hole would close it due to the Constellation) Healers Pump hard and ensure the Raid is full HP for each Star dying. Pre-cast on the Tank nonstop. When Big Bang happens, and if Algalon is positioned correctly, Hpals should instantly Divine Plea (as no healing is required here) and melee Algalon for 2-5 procs of Seal of Wisdom, before leaving safely. This makes a difference. Do your best to respect the cooldown rotation for the Black Hole explosions but if shit happens just postpone it for another explosion, as it is likely the second set of Stars might happen too early for DSacs to end their cooldown. If a Living Constellation sticks to you, try moving to the Offtank or slightly close to a Black Hole while keeping the Main Tank and the Raid full. It helps a lot. It is near-guaranteed that on the second Big Bang, there will remain one Constellation that cannot be removed since only one Black Hole remains. If this Constellation sticks to you, you must be the last Player to enter the Black Hole. If you enter too early the Black Hole will close and anyone who expected to enter after you will die. Any defensive CDs your class offers should be used on the upcoming death of Collapsing Stars, especially for the later ones where Living Constellations also cause random damage to the Raid. DPS This is a DPS check but obviously must not cause you to neglect your safety: Move out of Cosmic Smashes , of Collapsing Stars that are about to die , and move to the center of the room when in the Shadow Realm . Do not DPS/Cleave/Multidot AT ALL, unless instructed to, on the Collapsing Stars . Padding DPS on Algalon before escaping the Big Bang is a necessity, but leave a margin of 2 seconds at least. Ranged should spread so that Cosmic Smashes cause the lowest amount of Players to move. Similarly, Melees should stick to one side and move to the other if Cosmic Smash aims on their camp. The Tank might instead pull Algalon out a bit to allow you to continue DPSing by just moving forward. Any defensive CDs your class offers should be used on the upcoming death of Collapsing Stars , especially for the later ones where Living Constellations also cause random damage to the Raid. The last Big Bang goes: Some DPS -> Enter a Black Hole -> Move to the center of the room -> Move out of the center when you\u2019ve been removed from the Black Hole. Special Assignments Usually a Hunter (good execute, can control his damage, is mobile) or a Demolock (procs Decimation which carries over DPS on Algalon) will be assigned to kill Stars by himself, preferably one that can communicate on the status of the Star\u2019s HP. DBM should regardless be telling you when Stars are about to die.","title":"Algalon"},{"location":"special/algalon/#algalon-the-observer","text":"","title":"Algalon the Observer"},{"location":"special/algalon/#overview","text":"Algalon can only be accessed through a chain of quest that involves beating Iron Council HardMode, then all 4 Keepers Hard Mode (in any order and not necessarily in the same week).
