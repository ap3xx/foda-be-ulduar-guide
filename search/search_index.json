The Hard Mode must be toggled on by the Raid Leader before Trash is cleared. It is also known as \"4 Towers\", as there are 4 Towers found in the large area where Trash is cleared before the Boss. By default, you may choose to deactivate all these Towers. Otherwise, they will be active, empowering the Boss, and may be destroyed (to achieve a combination of Towers of your choice). Thus, for practice, it is possible to kill the Boss with 1, 2, or 3 towers. But this will not yield the \"Hard Mode\" loot table, and generally our time is better spent in other ways. Full Mechanics Rundown All the mechanics from Normal Mode, with no exception, remain . Each Tower greatly buffs the Boss and any Adds. The amount and stats of the buffs are somewhat irrelevant. The Tower of Frost causes Frost Beams (of Light Blue color) to sometimes appear in the arena. They will roam around, looking for Vehicles to lock onto. They cause no damage by themselves, but once locked on they will stop roaming around and prepare a projectile . If the Vehicle fails to escape the Beam when it locks onto it, it will be frozen and take a large amount of damage. All Players must be wary of this, as it may cause a wipe . Allies may free Frozen vehicles by shooting cannonballs on them . The Tower of Flame causes a Flame Beam (Orange/Red color) to roam the arena. This one causes constant, near-lethal damage, also leaving a similarly near-lethal burnt ground where it passed through . This \"fire wall\" can easily trap vehicles in corners where they might get killed by the Boss or unable to perform their assignment. All Players must be wary of it, and preemptively move away from the Flame Beam's path, and away from the Beam in general . The Tower of Storm causes a Storm Beam (Bright/White color) to appear in the arena. It is immobile but will deal massive damage to anyone in it. All Players must be wary of it . Must not be mistaken for Frost Beams. The Tower of Life causes Adds to appear in the 4 corners of the arena . There are both large, dangerous Adds and smaller, less threatening Adds. They appear as if created by the 4 Life Beams (green color) in the corners ; The Beams also do damage but should not be on the Players\u2019 paths anyway. Adds can be killed by all Players (though it is preferable to respect assignment) and may be knocked away (by ramming them) or slowed (by Oil Patches). Flame Leviathan actually has 4 NPCs on top of him, which are his Turrets. They cannot be conventionally killed. Once they are all 4 destroyed (simultaneously?), the Flame Leviathan will Shut Down, disabling it entirely for 20 seconds and taking +50% Damage for the duration . It also resets the stacks of his ramping-up Movement Speed. Essentials Siege Engine Driver You are the prime candidate to Ram Adds away to damage and control them. In fact, each Engine will be assigned to 1 corner of the arena each, and the 5th one will be assigned to always be on the Boss to Interrupt . Use your Dash to escape the dangerous Beams or the Boss. Estimated Difficulty of the role: 5/10 Siege Engine Passenger You must use Cannonballs to ignite Oil Patches created by the Choppers . That way, the Oil will burn Adds, killing them with ease. Use the Shield if your Driver drives into certain death and pain. Estimated Difficulty of the role: 4/10 Chopper Driver You actually have a job now! Drop Oil Patches in the 4 corners , where Adds spawn. They will be lit up by other Players to handle Adds that stand in the burning Oil. The more well-placed Oil Patches, the better. (One Chopper will be assigned per corner) You must go to the Boss when instructed to, to pick up assigned Players into your Passenger seat and drive them back to the safety of their Demolisher. There will be marked assignments to make sure each Chopper handles each Player back to its assigned Demolisher. Estimated Difficulty of the role: 7/10 Demolisher Driver Be extremely wary of your survival , as the premature death of a Demolisher means a certain wipe. ( Only applies to some Demolishers ) You must catapult your Passenger onto the Boss when instructed to . Make sure to aim directly on the Boss, preferably slightly towards his upper half. You cannot shoot Pyrite when your Passenger is loaded and awaiting your fire command, so be quick and make sure to refresh Pyrite one last time when we instruct Passengers to load themselves . The additional hazards of the Beams mean you might require more Pyrite than usual, as your Passenger might use it to give you a sprint. Make sure you drive close to Pyrite crates . Obviously, while your Passenger is gone, you will not be refueled Pyrite while in the driver seat! You can either refresh the Pyrite DoT the latest possible (recommended), or switch to the passenger seat, pick Pyrite, and switch back to the driver seat before the Pyrite DoT expires . Attention Not all Demolishers might be assigned to catapulting their passengers. (In which case your job will only be slightly harder than Normal Mode) Estimated Difficulty of the role: 9/10. Demolisher Passenger You will have to Sprint more often than in Normal Mode to escape danger, but keep in mind it costs a lot of the precious Pyrite. ( Only applies to some Demolishers ) Fill your vehicle to 100% Pyrite (\"mana\") before Catapulting yourself, if assigned to . Preferably wait to see your Driver shooting one last Pyrite projectile before loading up, as he will be unable to refresh Pyrite while you\u2019re loaded. If Catapulted successfully, kill Turrets A.S.A.P, using all DPS Cooldowns you can. Once Turrets are destroyed you will fall to the ground. You should not be in danger for the 20 seconds of the Shutdown, so make your way back to your assigned Demolisher - Either by walking or jumping into a friendly Chopper . If at any moment you\u2019re on the ground while the Boss isn\u2019t Shut Down , use as much survivability (healthstones\u2026) as possible and run to an empty vehicle. Attention Not all Demolishers might be assigned to catapulting their passengers. (In which case your job will only be slightly harder than Normal Mode) Estimated Difficulty of the role: 8.5/10. Special Assignments Siege Engines: Assigned to a corner or to stick on the Boss. Demolisher: Assigned or not to Catapult their Passengers. Choppers: Assigned to bring Passengers back to their Demolisher, and to each corner. 1 Shaman: Will be assigned to leave his vehicle and Heroism while close enough to the Boss, to help the Turret killers; then back to his vehicle. Note Due to the high variance of the fight (who gets chased, where do Flame Beams go\u2026) a picture would be mostly pointless.","title":"Flame Leviathan"},{"location":"hard/flame_leviathan/#hard-mode-flame-leviathan","text":"","title":"Hard Mode Flame Leviathan"},{"location":"hard/flame_leviathan/#overview","text":"This Hard Mode is significantly more challenging than the extremely simple Normal Mode (which can be cleared with 4-6 Players instead of 25, good for alts).

When that happens, XT is healed to full (rather than damaged), increases his total health by 60% and all his Damage by 15%. From that point on, some mechanics of the fight will change. It is ideal to kill the Heart by using as few Cooldowns as possible (both DPS individual CDs and Heroism) as these will be needed for the rest of the fight. Full Mechanics Rundown Both Debuffs will gain an additional new behavior : Searing Light when it expires, will instantly spawn an Add called Life Spark . This add deals high melee damage and thus needs to be picked up near-instantly by the Tank(s), and is likely to kill the Debuffed Player if not topped to full HP (No matter how good the tank is, the add likely will instantly melee the Player it spawns on). It also deals moderate AoE Nature damage around it. Life Sparks are #1 DPS Focus at any moment they exist. The Debuffed Player must thus not only move out of the Raid to not kill allies with Searing Light, but also make his way to be ~20yds away from the tank to allow for a very quick taunt. Gravity Bomb , on explosion, will not only damage and reel nearby Players in, but also leave a large void zone that will continuously slow and damage any Players that stand in it. This zone never goes away, and thus must be placed with care , far from the Raid but close enough for Healers to save the debuffed Players. A preemptive Hand of Freedom will greatly help the debuffed Player by making it immune to the zone\u2019s slow. One Paladin can provide enough Hands for every Gravity Bomb. XT will never enter Heart Phases again from the moment his Heart is broken (he doesn\u2019t have a Heart anymore to show, duh\u2026). As a consequence, no more Adds will spawn and individual DPS cooldowns may be used whenever they pull off the highest DPS. On the other hand, Healers will not be able to freely fix their mana. XT will cast Tympanic Tantrum on a fixed timer (1 minute). This is a long, channeled spell that deals insanely high Damage per second to the whole Raid, scaling on their Max HP (200% HP over the duration). This is a very demanding mechanic, for which I will thoroughly detail individual responsibilities in the Essentials below . When inactive, XT will technically be untargetable and instead plop down another NPC, his Heart, which takes +100% increased damage and carries over all the damage it takes to the \u201creal\u201d Boss\u2019 HP. Destroying the Heart enables Hard Mode, so do not be confused if we ask you to stop DPSing. In the meanwhile he will stop applying Debuffs (though left-overs Debuffs might still continue to be dangerous when Phase2 begins) and instead summon Adds: Repair Bots will greatly heal him if they reach him, but historically Warmane has failed to script that (lol) so don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll see if they\u2019re a problem. If they are, they can be crowd controlled, usually by Frost Nova or Elemental Shaman Earthbind. Bomb Bots are fragile and explode for Great damage on death, damaging both Players and nearby Repair Bots alike. Pummelers are strong Tank&Spank Adds that must be Misdirected to the Tank (possibly an Offtank) and killed when possible. They whirlwind but melees will survive the damage. After a while of Heart damage, Phase1 resumes. _XT begins a Heart Phase every time he loses 25% of his max HP, so Heart Phases can actually chain up very quickly if enough damage is dealt to the Heart__ - making the Normal Mode fight extremely trivial. Strategy Image Reference Essentials Tanks All Tanks should weave defensive cooldowns during Tantrum. XT is also punishing to Tanks outside of Tantrums, but Healers will have infinitely less pressure in those moments. Paladin Tanks can use Hand of Freedom on Gravity Bombs that are about to expire, and Hand of Protection on debuffed Players if a Tantrum is about to happen (the HoP will prevent Tantrum damage, but not the debuff itself. Taking damage from both is often lethal) Druid Tanks can use Barkskin + Tranquility during Tantrums (healing cooldowns will be on rotation) if they make sure they shift to Bear before the Tantrum ends. Healers For Tantrums, all Healers will be assigned to heal a group(1 to 5) and/or to specific targets . Is it primordial to respect that assignment as closely as possible, as the whole Raid will take very heavy damage and no Player can be left unhealed. Searing Light debuffed Players should receive a nonstop heal spam and sniped with a Heal that lands as perfectly as possible to the expiration of the debuff. Gravity Bombs must only be topped off + shielded. This is a very long fight with extremely high HPS output and mana preservation is paramount. Care should be paid to allow Paladins to Divine Plea and Tide/Hymns of Hope to be efficient. Extra-ordinary Healing Cooldowns (DHymn, Tranq) will be assigned. Two HPals will alternate Bubble+RaidSac on each Tantrum. Hpals will probably be assigned to heal melee groups. Resto Druids will probably actually be forbidden to use Tranquility at the profit of their better spells, unless we run 6+ Healers. Resto Shamans will likely be assigned to heal Ranged groups (they will be spread, but close enough for ChainHeals) Discipline will have to preshield as many Players as he can before Tantrum (ideally 25), then weave shield+PoH and PoM off cooldown. He will PoH his assigned group. HolyPriest will have to precast PoM and spam PoH+CoH on his assigned group. Might vary with talents. DPS All classes/specs DPS priority : Life Sparks >>>>> Any leftover Pummelers when Hard Mode begins >>> Boss. Healthstones should be saved for situations where a Searing Light is about to kill you or for a Tantrum where the Raid is starting to drop. In general, you\u2019re free to healthstone if you reach 20% hp during a Tantrum or from a Searing Light damage. Hitting zero Raid members with your Gravity Bomb is mandatory . Hitting the least possible Players with your Searing Lights is required, and you must be in Taunt range of the Tank when your Searing Light debuff expires . List of DPS classes/specs and your job during Tantrums : Arms/Fury : Enraged Regeneration and Shieldwall, preferably one per Tantrum and not the one Heroism will be used on. Ret : Might be assigned to DSac rotation. Freely use FoL heal procs on low hp Players. Sacred Shield yourself before Tantrum. Bubble/Shieldwall whenever lacking Forbearance. Hunter : Deterrence shouldn\u2019t help against Tantrum, but check if it does, once. Rather, use Deterrence when Searing Light is about to expire so that the Life Spark ignores you. Rogue : Use Feint on every Tantrum. Do not Cloak of Shadows a Gravity Bomb. Can Cloak of Shadows instantly on Searing Light, assuming the Tank can react accordingly. Shadow Priest : Will be assigned for a DHymn. For all other tantrums, should use PoM when Tantrum begins, and refresh DoTs just before. Might have to also spam PoH, but the push-back from Tantrum will probably make it inefficient. Death Knight : Must Death Strike at least once during the Tantrum and use IBF whenever up during a Tantrum. Save AMS for Searing Lights, as Tantrum is Physical Damage. If Frost, Ghoul+DeathPact whenever you\u2019re not using IBF. If Unholy, be ready to Death Pact if you reach 20% HP. Balance : Will be assigned to a Tranquility (with a Barkskin to avoid pushback). Will Barkskin every Tantrum anyway. Cast heals during the Tantrum, whichever is the highest output that doesn\u2019t get you oom (pre-shotting Lifeblooms right before Tantrum is a good idea). Is allowed to have bad DPS as a consequence. Feral : Will be assigned to a Tranquility (with a Barkskin to avoid pushback). Will Barkskin every Tantrum anyway. Survival Instincts whenever up. Shifting into Bear Form is not mandatory since Cat takes -30% AoE Damage, but can Bear+Frenzied Regen during his Survival Instincts. Mage : Can IceBlock freely on Tantrums, but better saved in case of a bad Searing Light. Obviously never Ice Block a Gravity Bomb and never Ice Block a Searing Light if you\u2019re not in range of the tank and outside the Raid. Always Blink when receiving a Searing Light. Warlocks : Affli should Drain Life during Tantrum and Death Coil during Tantrum whenever up. Demono should save Metamorphosis for Tantrum due to increased Armor and how he\u2019ll be free to run into melee range without fear of debuffs. Elemental : Must spam Chain Heals during the whole Tantrum. The temporary haste from Elemental Mastery will benefit those casts. Enhancement : Must expend Maelstrom procs into Chain Heals (or a nicely sniped Healing Wave) for the whole Tantrum. Can expend incomplete Maelstrom stacks for more heals. Use Shamanistic Rage right before each Tantrum. Use Wolves according to Trinkets/Burst cooldowns rather than just to heal yourself.

In general, you\u2019re free to healthstone if you reach 20% hp during a Tantrum or from a Searing Light damage. Hitting zero Raid members with your Gravity Bomb is mandatory . Hitting the least possible Players with your Searing Lights is required, and you must be in Taunt range of the Tank when your Searing Light debuff expires . List of DPS classes/specs and your job during Tantrums : Arms/Fury : Enraged Regeneration and Shieldwall, preferably one per Tantrum and not the one Heroism will be used on. Ret : Might be assigned to DSac rotation. Freely use FoL heal procs on low hp Players. Sacred Shield yourself before Tantrum. Bubble/Shieldwall whenever lacking Forbearance. Hunter : Deterrence shouldn\u2019t help against Tantrum, but check if it does, once. Rather, use Deterrence when Searing Light is about to expire so that the Life Spark ignores you. Rogue : Use Feint on every Tantrum. Do not Cloak of Shadows a Gravity Bomb. Can Cloak of Shadows instantly on Searing Light, assuming the Tank can react accordingly. Shadow Priest : Will be assigned for a DHymn. For all other tantrums, should use PoM when Tantrum begins, and refresh DoTs just before. Might have to also spam PoH, but the push-back from Tantrum will probably make it inefficient. Death Knight : Must Death Strike at least once during the Tantrum and use IBF whenever up during a Tantrum. Save AMS for Searing Lights, as Tantrum is Physical Damage. If Frost, Ghoul+DeathPact whenever you\u2019re not using IBF. If Unholy, be ready to Death Pact if you reach 20% HP. Balance : Will be assigned to a Tranquility (with a Barkskin to avoid pushback). Will Barkskin every Tantrum anyway. Cast heals during the Tantrum, whichever is the highest output that doesn\u2019t get you oom (pre-shotting Lifeblooms right before Tantrum is a good idea). Is allowed to have bad DPS as a consequence. Feral : Will be assigned to a Tranquility (with a Barkskin to avoid pushback). Will Barkskin every Tantrum anyway. Survival Instincts whenever up. Shifting into Bear Form is not mandatory since Cat takes -30% AoE Damage, but can Bear+Frenzied Regen during his Survival Instincts. Mage : Can IceBlock freely on Tantrums, but better saved in case of a bad Searing Light. Obviously never Ice Block a Gravity Bomb and never Ice Block a Searing Light if you\u2019re not in range of the tank and outside the Raid. Always Blink when receiving a Searing Light. Warlocks : Affli should Drain Life during Tantrum and Death Coil during Tantrum whenever up. Demono should save Metamorphosis for Tantrum due to increased Armor and how he\u2019ll be free to run into melee range without fear of debuffs. Elemental : Must spam Chain Heals during the whole Tantrum. The temporary haste from Elemental Mastery will benefit those casts. Enhancement : Must expend Maelstrom procs into Chain Heals (or a nicely sniped Healing Wave) for the whole Tantrum. Can expend incomplete Maelstrom stacks for more heals. Use Shamanistic Rage right before each Tantrum. Use Wolves according to Trinkets/Burst cooldowns rather than just to heal yourself.","title":"DPS"},{"location":"hard/xt002/#special-assignments","text":"Not really any, aside all that\u2019s written above","title":"Special Assignments"},{"location":"normal/flame_leviathan/","tags":["Skippable: False","Difficult: Very Easy"],"text":"Flame Leviathan Overview This Boss is entirely fought in vehicles , in a large arena.
