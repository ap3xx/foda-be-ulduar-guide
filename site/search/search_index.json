There are 3 types of vehicles: Demolisher, Siege Engine, Chopper. All 3 vehicles allow for a driver and a passenger; and the amount of each type of vehicle is limited. Full Mechanics Rundown Has no Threat table . Instead, chases a Demolisher or Siege Engine, Ramming it ( and anyone in Ramming range ) if allowed to close the gap; dealing high physical damage. Gains Movement Speed over time. Casts Flame Vents , a high Raid-Wide damage that can only be Interrupted by the Siege Engine drivers. Also deals some unavoidable Raid-Wide damage, acting as a Soft-Enrage. Essentials Siege Engine Driver May ram enemies, dealing low damage and knocking them away. Can also do a short dash forward to escape danger. Irrelevant in Normal Mode. Must Interrupt Flame Vents . Can only be done at short range. Estimated Difficulty of the role: 2/10 Siege Engine Passenger May protect the Siege Engine with a large shield in case of danger. Long cooldown. Must shoot down Flying Adds , as many as possible, with Anti-Air Rockets (no cooldown) Can do pitiful damage with cannonballs. Irrelevant in Normal Mode. Estimated Difficulty of the role: 1/10 Demolisher Driver May shoot cannonballs. Low damage. May shoot Liquid Pyrite, costing 10% of the Vehicle\u2019s \u201cMana\u201d . It deals low damage on impact but applies a huge DoT, which can be stacked to 10. Almost all of the Damage dealt to the Boss will come from this. It is essential to keep this DoT stacked to 10. May catapult his Passenger like a projectile. Serves no purpose in Normal Mode.

It is essential to supply your Driver with a constant supply of it . May spend 50% of the Vehicle\u2019s \u201cMana\u201d to double the Vehicle\u2019s Movement Speed for 20 seconds. Should only be used for dire emergencies (e.g getting Chased by the Boss) May load himself into the vehicle\u2019s catapult. Serves no purpose in Normal Mode. Estimated Difficulty of the role: 5/10 Chopper Is much faster than other Vehicles and cannot be Chased by the Boss. Can drop Oil Patches, do pitiful AoE Damage, and heal any passenger.
